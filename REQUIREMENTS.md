# Requirements

Implement the Atomic Design methodology in structuring your project.
Divide the application into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.

Create a TypeScript interface for the task object, defining properties such as id,
name, and completed.

Design and style the application using CSS, focusing on Atomic Design principles.
Consider the styling for atoms (e.g., buttons, input fields), molecules (e.g., task item),
and organisms (e.g., task list).

Include an input field to add new tasks.

Display a list of tasks with checkboxes to mark them as completed.

Implement functionality to remove completed tasks.

Apply TypeScript for handling the logic of adding, marking as completed, and
removing tasks.

Ensure that TypeScript types are used consistently throughout the application.

## Implementation

Use Atomic Design principles to organize your project structure.

Utilize TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

Implement CSS for styling based on the principles of Atomic Design.

Make the application responsive and visually appealing.

Include a README file explaining the Atomic Design choices made during
development and any other relevant considerations.

## Bonus

Implement local storage functionality to persist tasks even after the page is refreshed.

Add animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.

Allow users to edit task names.

Include lint or style configurations of your choice, such as eslint, stylelint,
prettier, or other.

Include unit tests using a testing framework of your choice, such as jest.
